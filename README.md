Ryan Durnan Lab7 Submission

This lab required me to look up 5 different algorithms for sorting a vector of numbers. Then, I 
had to implement said algorithms in C++. With everything built, I found out how long the vector 
could be for each function to execute in about 4 seconds. After that, I recorded how long it 
took for each function to finish sorting vectors double/quadruple the original length. 
Based on the timings, I finished by predicting how long it would take each function to 
sort a vector with 2 million entries. 

I borrowed code from Lab6 in order to create random vectors and track how much time each 
function needed to execute. I included the required files in this repository (RandomUtilities.h, 
winTimer.cpp, winTimer.h). The test code will not run without those files.

For the bubble sorting algorithm, I used the following site:

For the insertion sorting algorithm, I used the following site:

For the selection sorting algorithm, I used the following site: 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/

For the merge sorting algorithm, I used the following site: 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/

For the quick-sort sorting algorithm, I used the following site:
